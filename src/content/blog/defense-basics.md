Defense often separates good players from great ones. You don’t need to be the tallest or quickest player to be an excellent defender—you need **focus**, **discipline**, and **consistent footwork**.

Here are the fundamentals that matter most:

### **1. Build a strong stance**
Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, knees bent, hips low, and your weight on the balls of your feet. Your hands should be active without reaching.

### **2. Slide, don’t cross your feet**
Crossing your feet slows you down and makes you easier to beat. Instead, push off your back foot and slide to stay squared up.

### **3. Read your opponent, not the ball**
Watch their chest or shoulders—these don’t fake as easily as the ball does. This helps you react faster to real movement.

### **4. Contest without fouling**
Jump straight up with high hands. Don’t swipe down; it almost always leads to fouls.

Defense is about effort, but it’s also about knowing what the offense wants to do—and taking it away.
