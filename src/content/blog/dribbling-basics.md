Dribbling is where confidence starts in basketball. Great ball handlers aren’t always the fastest players—they’re the players who can **control the ball under pressure**, stay balanced, keep their head up, and maintain good spacing.

To improve your dribble, focus on three key things:

### **1. Stay low and balanced**
A lower stance makes the ball travel a shorter distance, which means defenders have less time to steal it. Bend your knees, widen your base, and keep your hips stable.

### **2. Keep your eyes up**
Good dribblers see the floor. Try practicing dribbling while looking forward instead of down. Even glancing ahead for half the drill helps you build better habits.

### **3. Use your fingertips, not your palm**
Your control improves dramatically when you dribble with your **finger pads** instead of slapping the ball with your palm.

Master the basics slowly—the speed will come naturally once the technique is consistent.
